    "### 🤔 First: What is a Doubly Linked List?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Doubly Linked List is a linear data structure where each node contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data`: the value stored in the node\n",
    "- `prev`: a pointer to the previous node\n",
    "- `next`: a pointer to the next node\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each node points both ways, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traverse forward (like in a singly linked list)\n",
    "- Traverse backward efficiently (which singly linked lists can’t do)\n",
    "- Insert or delete from either end or in the middle with more flexibility than arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 1. insert_at_beginning(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "We're inserting a new node at the front (left end). This is like pushing to the front of a train.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Very efficient when you need to add data at the start. It's an O(1) operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new node.\n",
    "2. Point its `.next` to the current head.\n",
    "3. If the list isn’t empty, point the old head’s `.prev` to this new node.\n",
    "4. Update `head` to this new node.\n",
